They had a blast ðŸ¤©\nHans was very nice with them and answered all their questions and curiosities\n\nAdults enjoyed their time, we brought pizza and drinks and enjoyed the sunset and watching animals and birds. \n\nHans took his time to explain things around nanaimo and the animals that live around. \n\nWe highly recommend this trip with Hans!",

      "text": "Hans fit us in a bit last-minute and we had an absolutely amazing time! It was just the two of us and Hans on board and we loved talking to him, hanging out on the nets of the catamaran, and even driving the boat! Hans is an awesome guy with a very sweet dog. He even cooked up some crab and shared it with us - and it was the best crab we have ever tasted. We are a young British/Italian couple who are travelling around Canada for several months and we will remember this boat trip fondly and wish Hans all the best. We will definitely come back one day. Thank you Hans for being so amazing!",
