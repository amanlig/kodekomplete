# Orion telemetry simulator

In-process simulation of Orion-Tr DC/DC (`0x04`) and Orion XS (`0x0f`) Instant
Readout advertisements. No Orion, real key, Bluetooth adapter or pairing is needed.
The public synthetic key and product ID match the independent test fixtures.
This models telemetry, not charger firmware, electrical dynamics or battery safety.

From the repository root:

```sh
cargo run --manifest-path simulation/orion/Cargo.toml --locked -- --model tr
cargo run --manifest-path simulation/orion/Cargo.toml --locked -- --model xs --scenario faults --interval-ms 100
cargo run --manifest-path simulation/orion/Cargo.toml --locked -- --model xs --scenario normal --steps 60
```

Default: 24 steps, one second each, fault scenario. Ctrl-C stops early. Use `--help`
for options. Relative explicit paths are relative to the working directory.
Default databases are unique files under `simulation/orion/data/`; every supplied
`--database PATH` must also be a new file. All observations use `SIMULATED-ORION`,
never the real device ID. The output prints the database path for inspection:

```sh
cargo run --manifest-path device-interface/Cargo.toml --locked -- observations /path/to/simulation.sqlite3 100
```

## Pipeline and scenario

The simulator serializes readings in protocol wire units and encrypts the payload
with AES-128 CTR. It passes the advertisement to the production `VictronMonitor`,
which decrypts, normalizes and persists through `ObservationStore`. It calls the
production freshness timer and explicitly stops the monitor at completion.
The Bluetooth adapter and scan supervisor are bypassed; this does not test radio
reception, scanner retries or mobile lifecycle behavior.

| Zero-based step | Fault scenario |
| --- | --- |
| 3 | Repeat preceding packet; no duplicate stored sample |
| 5 | Unavailable measurements become NULL/Unknown |
| 6 | Truncated encrypted packet rejected; run continues |
| 8–12 | No advertisements; stale timeout is three intervals |
| 13 | Reception resumes |
| 14 | Wrong key-check byte causes KeyRequired |
| 15 | Packet ignored while a key is required |
| 16 | Explicitly reload synthetic key and recover |
| 18 | Synthetic off/error status |

Other steps emit changing voltage/current and bulk/absorption/float state codes.
TR omits current fields. The fault sequence occurs once; `normal` omits all injected
faults. The error code and off-reason are illustrative, not a diagnosis of a real
charger. Key recovery uses the core API, not real key-file provisioning. Keys and
nonce reuse are public test data and must not be used for secure transmission.

## Validation

```sh
cargo test --manifest-path simulation/orion/Cargo.toml --locked
cargo clippy --manifest-path simulation/orion/Cargo.toml --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

Encryption is checked against committed, independently generated OpenSSL fixtures
for both record formats, not just an encoder/decoder round trip. A production-monitor
test checks storage, duplicates, stale detection, key recovery and missing values.
Build requirements are inherited from `device-interface`, including a C compiler
for bundled SQLite and Linux vendored D-Bus. No system Bluetooth service is needed
to run this simulator. This development crate has its own Cargo.lock; it adds no
new library families beyond the [device-interface inventory](../../docs/library-licenses.md).

Green means implemented within this in-process scope. Physical Orion validation
remains shelved. See the [handoff](../../docs/status-2026-10-02.md).

The CLI integration test executes the full XS fault scenario, verifies 15 samples
(105 observations, four NULL values), and confirms that rerunning against an
existing database fails without changing its observations.
