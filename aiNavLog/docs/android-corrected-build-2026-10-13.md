# Corrected Android package build — October 13, 2026

**Play upload blocked:** the owner attempted upload and Play rejected this AAB's
signing certificate. See the [end-of-day handoff](status/status-2026-10-13.md)
for fingerprints and recovery steps. Do not retry this artifact unchanged.

Signed AAB rebuilt successfully with the owner's exact required package:
`com.kodekomplete.com.ainavlog`. The original `com.kodekomplete.ainavlog` build
is superseded; keep it only as historical evidence.

Checks passed: typecheck, lint, ZIP CRC, compiled manifest contains the corrected
package and no old package marker, and signing-block presence. The configuration
uses the same standalone Electrical demo as the original artifact; UI behavior
was not changed. No Rust/Bluetooth integration, successful Google Play upload or physical
installation is claimed. The new package's signing credentials are managed by
Expo; no private keystore was downloaded or committed.

This AAB has the required package but needs signing-key recovery before Play can accept it. The store
package identity is permanent; the visible app name is separately editable.
