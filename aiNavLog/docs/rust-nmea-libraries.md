# Rust NMEA library usage

The Device Interface uses **nmea-kit 0.8.9** for NMEA 0183 and **canboat 8.3.0**
for NMEA 2000. Both decode and encode messages through the interfaces in
[`protocol.rs`](../device-interface/src/protocol.rs). This guide describes the
implemented wrappers, not every feature offered by the upstream libraries.

## Dependencies and toolchain

The dependencies are declared in
[`Cargo.toml`](../device-interface/Cargo.toml); exact resolved versions are in
[`Cargo.lock`](../device-interface/Cargo.lock).

```toml
nmea-kit = "0.8.9"
canboat = { version = "8.3.0", default-features = false, features = ["decode"] }
```

nmea-kit uses its default features. CANboat's `decode` feature includes the
embedded PGN database, decoding and encoding. Its default CLI and optional device
I/O features are disabled. The package requires **Rust 1.96 or newer**; development
was verified with Rust 1.98.1.

See the [license inventory](library-licenses.md) for dependency licenses and
notices: nmea-kit offers MIT or Apache-2.0, and CANboat uses Apache-2.0.

## Interfaces and message boundaries

Import `ProtocolDecoder` and `ProtocolEncoder` to call their methods. Each trait
has an associated result type, so implementations retain protocol-specific data.

| Implementation | Decode input → result | Encode input → result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Nmea0183Codec` | `str` → `Nmea0183Message` | `Nmea0183Message` → `String` |
| `Nmea2000Codec` | CANboat `Frame` → `DecodedPgn` | CANboat `PgnBuilder` → `Frame` |

Both methods return `DeviceResult<T>`. They perform synchronous, in-memory work
and can be called from an async transport loop. Encoding does not send anything.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Transport input] --> B[Sentence framing or PGN reassembly]
    B --> C[ProtocolDecoder]
    C --> D[Protocol-specific message]
    E[Typed sentence or PGN builder] --> F[ProtocolEncoder]
    F --> G[Sentence or complete PGN payload]
    G --> H[Transport formatting and transmission]
```

Transport implementations must separate incoming sentences and reassemble CAN
fragments before calling these codecs. Mapping their output into `DecodedReading`
and `Observation` is a separate step. The provisional `DeviceProtocolAdapter`
and `ObservationNormalizer` are still stubs; the BLE evaluation CLI does not yet
feed data into the codecs.

## NMEA 0183 with nmea-kit

Implementation: [`nmea0183.rs`](../device-interface/src/protocol/nmea0183.rs).

This example decodes a heading, constructs a new heading using a typed nmea-kit
sentence, and encodes both through the shared interface:

```rust
use ainavlog_device_interface::{
    protocol::nmea0183::{nmea::Hdt, NmeaSentence},
    Nmea0183Codec, Nmea0183Message, ProtocolDecoder, ProtocolEncoder,
};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let mut codec = Nmea0183Codec;
    let received = codec.decode("$GPHDT,123.456,T*32\r\n")?;

    assert_eq!(received.frame().talker, "GP");
    if let NmeaSentence::Hdt(heading) = received.sentence() {
        println!("True heading in degrees: {:?}", heading.heading_true);
    }

    // Forward the original fields without rounding through typed measurements.
    let forwarded = codec.encode(&received)?;
    assert_eq!(forwarded, "$GPHDT,123.456,T*32\r\n");

    let outgoing = Nmea0183Message::from_sentence(
        "GP",
        &Hdt { heading_true: Some(90.0) },
    )?;
    let wire = codec.encode(&outgoing)?;
    assert!(wire.ends_with("\r\n"));
    Ok(())
}
```

`Nmea0183Message` owns its validated input and typed interpretation:

- `sentence()` returns the typed `NmeaSentence` enum.
- `frame()` exposes the prefix, talker, sentence type, raw fields and tag metadata.
- `as_str()` returns the stored input with trailing CR/LF removed.
- `from_sentence()` accepts nmea-kit types implementing `NmeaEncodable`.
  Standard outbound talkers must be two uppercase ASCII letters/digits.
  Proprietary sentence types supply their own address.

The decoder accepts one ASCII sentence at a time, optionally with CRLF and an
IEC 61162-450 tag block. Supplied checksums are validated; checksumless input is
accepted. Encoding generates a sentence checksum and CRLF and preserves an
existing tag block. It does not guarantee byte-identical whitespace or checksum
letter casing when forwarding.

Missing or malformed numeric measurements follow nmea-kit and become `None`.
Non-finite outbound numeric values become empty fields. Unknown and proprietary
content is retained, even when it has no typed representation. AIS `!` envelopes
are preserved as raw fields; this wrapper does not decode AIS payloads or
reassemble multipart AIS messages, despite the upstream library offering AIS APIs.

## NMEA 2000 with CANboat

Implementation: [`nmea2000.rs`](../device-interface/src/protocol/nmea2000.rs).

A CANboat `Frame` carries a **complete PGN payload**, plus priority, source,
destination and optional timestamp. It can exceed eight bytes. It is not a raw
CAN fragment, USB packet or gateway byte stream.

Use CANboat's schema identifier to create a `PgnBuilder`; generated field IDs
provide typed references to schema fields. Header methods consume and return the
builder, while `push()` mutates it, so bind the builder before adding fields:

```rust
use ainavlog_device_interface::{
    protocol::nmea2000::{ids::field::wind_data as wd, EncodeValue, Units},
    Nmea2000Codec, ProtocolDecoder, ProtocolEncoder,
};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let mut codec = Nmea2000Codec::new(Units::Si);
    let mut request = codec.message("windData")?
        .source(42)
        .destination(255)
        .priority(2)
        .timestamp("2026-10-01T00:00:00Z");

    request.push(wd::SID, EncodeValue::Int(1))?;
    request.push(wd::WIND_SPEED, 5.23)?; // m/s
    request.push(wd::WIND_ANGLE, 1.5)?; // radians with SI schema
    request.push(wd::REFERENCE, EncodeValue::Lookup("Apparent".into()))?;

    let frame = codec.encode(&request)?;
    assert_eq!(frame.pgn, 130306);
    let decoded = codec.decode(&frame)?;
    assert_eq!(decoded.src, 42);

    if let Some(speed) = decoded.field(wd::WIND_SPEED) {
        println!("Wind speed: {:?} {:?}", speed.value.as_f64(), speed.unit());
    }
    if let Some(angle) = decoded.field(wd::WIND_ANGLE) {
        println!("Wind angle in degrees: {:?}", angle.as_f64_in("deg"));
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

`Nmea2000Codec::default()` selects CANboat's Metric schema. Use `new(Units::Si)`
for SI. Consult each field's units rather than assuming that a numeric value is
already in application units; `as_f64_in()` converts supported unit pairs.

For fields chosen at runtime, the builder also exposes `push_by_name()`, and the
decoded message exposes `field_by_name()`. Native builder methods support repeating
sets. Omitted fields use schema defaults, which can include unavailable sentinels;
inspect `FieldValue::is_not_available()` or optional numeric accessors instead of
substituting zero.

`DecodedPgn` retains PGN identity, CAN header metadata, timestamp, raw payload and
interpreted fields. Unknown PGNs follow CANboat's fallback definitions when
available, or return a decoding error. The wrapper checks priority, PGN range,
maximum payload length and the selected schema's minimum payload length.

Incoming gateway parsing and fast-packet/ISO-TP reassembly, outgoing fragmentation,
address claiming and physical transmission remain transport/integration work.
Setting `.source(42)` only sets message metadata; it does not claim that address.

## Errors and verification

Wrapper errors use `DeviceError::Decode(String)` or `DeviceError::Encode(String)`.
Calls made directly on the re-exported CANboat builder, such as `push()`, return
CANboat errors. The examples use `Box<dyn Error>` to propagate both error types.
A successfully decoded message can still contain missing measurements.

From `device-interface`:

```sh
cargo test --locked --test nmea_codecs
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

The [codec tests](../device-interface/tests/nmea_codecs.rs) cover heading round
trips, known wind-data bytes, metadata, tag/raw-field preservation, malformed input,
unavailable values and complete PGN payloads longer than one CAN frame. These are
in-memory checks; live gateway and mobile integration have not been validated.
